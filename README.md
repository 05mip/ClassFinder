<h1>UCI WebReg Schedule Maker</h1>

<p>This program is still a work in progress</p>
<p>The program asks for input from user of which courses they need to sign up for for a given quarter. 
  It then processes all of the courses and finds the most optimal schedule.
  The most optimal schedule is determined by 2 things: The rating of the professor on Rate My Professor and the time of the class
  The judgement for how good a class is is based on how far away from a certain time they are.</p>
